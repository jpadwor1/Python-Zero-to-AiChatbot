"""
2. List Length:

Create a list of five animals. Write a program that prints a message telling the user how many animals are in the list.
**HINT** try to use a variable to keep track of the amount of animals and loop through the list. 
"""

"""
3. Chatbot Song Queue:

Imagine the chatbot can queue up to three songs for a user. Allow the user to add songs to the list until there are three songs in the queue. Once the queue is full, display the list of songs to the user.
