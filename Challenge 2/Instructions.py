Simple Interactive Diary

Diaries have been a way for people to keep track of their thoughts, memories, and experiences. In the digital age, having a basic understanding of how to create an interactive diary application is a great way to practice programming concepts. The purpose of the Simple Interactive Diary is to provide practice in using lists, loops, conditional statements, and user input.

Simple Interactive Diary allows the user to add, view, and delete diary entries. Each entry is stored sequentially, and the user can interact with them using a simple menu.

This challenge requires that the developer implementing it follow these constraints:

The diary entries must be stored in a list.
The user should be able to interact with the diary using a while loop until they choose to exit.
Conditional statements must be used to handle the user's menu choices.

User Stories:

User can view a menu with options to add an entry, view entries, delete an entry, or exit.
User can add a new diary entry which gets stored in the diary.
User can view all diary entries with a unique entry number.
User can delete a diary entry using the entry number.
User is notified of successful additions or deletions.
User can exit the diary application.

Bonus features:

Implement a search feature where the user can search for specific words or phrases in the diary entries.
Allow the user to edit an existing diary entry.
