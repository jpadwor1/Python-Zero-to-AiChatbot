Challenge 1: Username Generator


Objective:
Develop a program that takes user input and combines them using an f-string to create a unique and personalized username.

Description:
Usernames are essential in the digital age, whether for social media, gaming, or professional platforms. In this challenge, you'll be creating a program that asks users about their childhood street name and their pet's name. The goal is to combine these names using Python's f-string to generate a unique username that's both personal and memorable.

Features:

Gather User Input:

Ask the user for the name of the street they grew up on.
Ask the user for the name of their pet.
Combine Names using f-string:

Use an f-string to combine the street name and the pet's name.
Display Username:

Show the user their generated username.
Sample Flow:

User is prompted: "What was the name of the street you grew up on?"
User enters: "Maplewood"
User is prompted: "What was your pet's name?"
User enters: "Whiskers"
The program generates the username: "Maplewood_Whiskers" using an f-string and displays it to the user.
Constraints:

Ensure that the user's input for the street name and pet's name is not empty. If it is, prompt them again.
Bonus Features:

Allow the user to choose a separator (like a hyphen, underscore, or period) to use between the names.
Add a feature where the program suggests multiple username variations for the user to choose from.
