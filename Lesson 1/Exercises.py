Homework for Video 1:
Building Blocks for Our AI Chatbot:

As we progress through this series, each homework assignment will contribute to our final project: an AI Chatbot. Let's start by laying the foundation.

1. User Profile for Chatbot:
    Create Your Own Boxes (Variables):
        Make a variable named userName and store your name in it. Then, print its content.
        Make another variable named userAge and store your age in it. Print its content.
    
2. Interacting with the Chatbot:
    Change Box Contents:
        Imagine the chatbot asks you for your favorite color. Create a variable named userFavoriteColor and store your favorite color in it. Then, print a message like: "Your favorite color is [color]."
        Now, imagine the chatbot asks how you feel today. Create a variable named userMood and store a mood (e.g., "happy", "sad", "excited"). Print a message like: "Today, you are feeling [mood]."

3. Data Types for Chatbot Understanding:
    Understanding Different Responses:
        Create a variable named isFirstTimeUser and set it to True if it's your first interaction with the chatbot, or False otherwise. Print its content.
        Create a variable named chatbotRating and store a number between 1 to 10 based on how you'd rate the chatbot's performance so far. Print its content."
