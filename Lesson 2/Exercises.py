Homework 2:
Building More Interactivity for Our AI Chatbot:


1. Traffic Light Decisions:

Write a program that asks the user for the current traffic light color (red, yellow, green) and then tells the user what action they should take (stop, slow down, go).


2. Chatbot Mood Enhancements:

Expand the chatbot mood interaction from the lesson. If the user says they're "tired", the chatbot should respond with "Maybe you should take a break." If the user says they're "excited", the chatbot should say "That's awesome! What's the occasion?"


3. Personalized Greetings: 

Create a program where the chatbot asks for the user's name and the current time (morning, afternoon, evening). Depending on the time provided, the chatbot should greet the user with "Good morning, [name]!", "Good afternoon, [name]!", or "Good evening, [name]!".
