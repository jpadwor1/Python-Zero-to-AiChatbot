Homework for Video 9:

Alarm Clock:
Task: Create a simple alarm clock that takes in a time and waits until that time to sound an alarm (print a message).
Tips
1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Get the current system time.
3. Prompt the user to input the desired alarm time (consider using a specific format, e.g., HH:MM).
4. Convert the user's input into a comparable time format.
5. Use a loop to constantly check the system time.
6. If the system time matches the alarm time, print the alarm message and exit the loop.


Birthday Countdown:
Task: Ask the user for their birthdate and calculate how many days are left until their next birthday.

1. Prompt the user for their birthdate (consider specifying a format, e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
2. Convert the user's input into a date format.
3. Get the current system date.
4. Determine the user's next birthday (might be this year or the next year).
5. Calculate the difference in days between the current date and the next birthday.
6. Print the number of days left until the user's next birthday.

Area Calculator:
Task: Design a program that calculates the area of different shapes (circle, square, rectangle). Use the math module for necessary calculations.

1. Import the math module.
2. Print a menu for the user with choices (e.g., 1 for circle, 2 for square, etc.).
3. Ask the user to select a shape.
4. Based on the user's choice:
    a. If it's a circle:
        Prompt for the radius.
        
    b. If it's a square:
        Prompt for the side length.

    c. If it's a rectangle:
        Prompt for the width and height.
5. Calculate the area using width * height.
6. Print the calculated area for the selected shape.
