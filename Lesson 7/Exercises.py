1. Movie Night Decision:

You and your friends are trying to decide if you should go out for a movie. Write a program that helps you decide based on the following conditions:

You will go if it's a weekend OR if there's a special weekday discount.
However, if it's raining AND you don't have an umbrella, you won't go, regardless of the other conditions.

# Example:
# Is it a weekend? (True/False): True
# Is there a special weekday discount? (True/False): False
# Is it raining? (True/False): True
# Do you have an umbrella? (True/False): False
# Decision: Better stay at home.

A fitness class has specific signup requirements. Write a program that checks if a person can sign up based on the following:

# Example:
# Enter your age: 16
# Is the class full? (True/False): False

You're building an online shopping cart. Write a program that determines if a user can checkout based on the following:
